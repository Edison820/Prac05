In Visual Studio Code (VSCode), I can effortlessly modify the background color of a web page by adjusting the CSS styling. Begin by opening your HTML file and ensuring that you have a linked CSS file in the <head> section. If not, create one in the same directory as your HTML file. In the CSS file, target the body element and set the background-color property to the desired color value. This can be done using color names, hex codes, or RGB values. For example, to set the background color to light blue, use the CSS rule body { background-color: lightblue; }. After saving both my HTML and CSS files, open my HTML file in a web browser to preview the changes. Optionally, if you have the Live Server extension installed, you can right-click on the HTML file in VSCode and select "Open with Live Server" for real-time updates as my modify the background color.
